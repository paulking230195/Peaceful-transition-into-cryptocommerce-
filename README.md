               Abstract 

         
The social and legal implications that blockchain technology brings about, not only due to its ideological framework, but also, and especially, due to the concept of law it inaugurates. Thus, this article claims, that, by interlocking technological and legal structures, blockchain technology initiates a peaceful displacement of legal symbolics and imaginaries. Starting with an overview of the technological details of blockchain, the paper then addresses its ideological context and traces the underlying ideas, values and functions and their relation with—and impact on—the general perception of law and legal issues. By critically assessing the claim that blockchain will liberate the subject from any heteronymic constraints, this paper analyses to what extent this technology has social and legal implications that reach far beyond its virtual, purely blockchain-related scope of applications—and why this technology should matter to us all.


                      Introduction 


Blockchain technology has been described as having the potential to disrupt every inch of society. By means of decentralization and disintermediation it is said to liberate the individual citizen from potentially corrupt institutions and data-greedy companies, to accelerate and facilitate administrative and legal processes. Blockchain is meant to function as a ‘new and relatively perfected system for value objectification’ and thus to replace those third parties on which value systems such as currencies (bank), religions (church) or legal systems (state) have so far relied when objectifying, or determining, their values. As a result, a growing number of economic, legal and political associations are currently experimenting with blockchain applications. However, the enthusiasm with which this technology is welcomed tends to obscure the fact that it comes with a whole new set of socio-technological imaginaries that are likely to have a profound impact on the juridical-cultural settings of society.
hidden politics and legal and regulatory challenges posed by the advent of blockchain technology. Aiming to ‘cut through the problematic of blockchain hype’, blockchain’s nature as ‘a type of control technology that displaces or even replaces law’  as a driving force for a new emerging legal field and on ‘the future of sovereignty in a blockchain world’. This emerging legal field has since further developed, with the growing sector of ‘legal tech’, including applications sprouting up like decentralized dispute resolution, decentralized law firms etc.


           What is blockchain 

A blockchain is essentially a public, decentralized, digitized registry stored on peer-to-peer networked computers that enables the fully transparent storage and continuous updating of information, and their unchangeable concatenation in chains of transactions laid down in blocks. This technology was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, a person or group of persons who founded the crypto-currency Bitcoin and have concealed their identities behind this pseudonym until today. Their idea was to render the need for trusted third parties superfluous by creating a collectively guaranteed and consensus-based, thus forgery-proof procedure for information storage. 

Due to a consensus-based procedure for storage (proof of work/proof of stake), which confirms the validity of any new information in a way that is accessible and verifiable for all parties involved, and due to the concatenation of the data and the decentralised nature of the system, a change or falsification of the stored information becomes im- or hardly possible, as this would require the consent of a majority of 51% of the parties involved in block creation, which is hardly achievable in most blockchains, especially in the case of dishonest intentions. Thus, and this is the central element of this technology, the trust in a third party guaranteeing the correctness of the information becomes superfluous—the talk is of trustless trust,i.e. trust in the underlying code of the blockchain is sufficient. 

In addition to the Bitcoin blockchain, numerous other blockchains have to this day emerged, such as for example Ethereum, which go beyond the technological capacities of Bitcoin in that, in addition to monetary transactions, they offer the possibility ‘to store or reference other forms of information, including what are essentially small computer programs. This means that, due to the fact that each blockchain code contains an integrated crypto-currency, sending an amount of that specific crypto-currency or feeding the system with new information can trigger, automatically and in real time, a code change in another account or the actuation of a programmable machine. For example, when an agreed crypto-currency amount is received on the account of the owner or seller, the intelligent door of the rented apartment opens or the ownership of the digitizable object is transferred to the buyer. By means of these smart contracts, it is possible to transfer certain legal transactions into code and to integrate individually negotiated contractual conditions into the underlying algorithmic network of a blockchain in order to have them automatically executed. The possibility of forgery-proof storage of information and the unambiguous cryptological linking of transaction data to a specific person makes the execution of such contract-like programs especially secure. 

These quasi-contractual programmes and structures, which can be executed transnationally and autonomously, i.e. ‘independently of any government or other centralized authority’ are one of the main reasons why blockchain technology is said to have the ability to ‘fracture economic and social processes, to bring intermediaries to their knees and to even attack the essence of institutions at their core’ .





Peaceful Displacement of Symbolic and Imaginary Basis of Law 



The so called lex cryptographia is mainly constituted by the new quasi-legal structure of smart contracts that are being used for regulating and initiating two- or morefold relationships of (trustless) trust. Given that these smart contracts can be set up by two or more parties that are located anywhere across the globe, this law operates entirely detached from the traditional ‘third party’, i.e. the cultural and national basis of legal legitimacy. Lex cryptographia is a law that is no longer legitimized by a culturally established symbolic referent which it no longer needs to be as there is no longer a need for recognition or belief: by programming the code, the parties to a smart contract are making law, implying—or rather coding—the values they take to be fundamental, and initiating the law’s automatic execution: legal basis, law writing, law and its enforcement fall into one. 

The replacement of the symbolic referent with code, however, implies at the same time a profound displacement of the traditional imagery and symbolic basis of law: not only does the coded lex cryptographia initiate a detachment from the traditional symbolic referent as its legal legitimacy. It also dissociates the concept of law in general from those three dimensions of human life that are constitutive for the necessity to agree on a common representation of the world, and that are the core elements of the symbolic and imaginary framework a society’s institutional and legal system are traditionally rooted in: the territory, language and the body. 

Emancipation from Language and Interpretation 

Firstly, blockchain law initiates an emancipation from language. where language itself is being abolished as ‘carrier of law’ , Instead it is being replaced by the code of the blockchain. lex cryptographia operates according to the ‘logical principle of noncontradiction’. It is conceived as free of ‘anything ambivalent or paradoxical’ i.e. free of the irrational and unreasonable dimension that defines human and social life. Once it is programmed, it acts as ‘robotic law’; all stages of a legal procedure, even sentences or penalties, are automated and executed independently from any controlling entity. 

The distributed ledger, [these data] could be used to prevent automated doors from opening for people whom a smart-contract risk-assessment service rates below a threshold of desirability.  Once delivered and booked into jails, smart courts could automate sentences based on an automated assessment of future crime potential .


        Emancipation from Territory


Secondly, the decentralized blockchain structure cuts all legal ties with any territory. Blockchain law now claims to no longer need any tie to a traditional corpus or territory. The decentralized and algorithmic establishment of legitimacy implies the idea of a law that is completely detached from the ‘corpus mysticum’ of the state. Rule sets are therefore negotiated on a case-by-case basis, independently of any legal corpus, depending on the will of the respective transaction partners and the conditions of the individual situation. 


         Emancipation from the Body


Thirdly, blockchain law conceives a form of legal subjectivity that abolishes its corporeality.


By integrating the individual’s body into the corpus of law, the legal institutions of a society guarantee that the body is not treated as a commodified object. 

with digitization, a first step has been taken into the direction of a matter-free existence. with e-residency that was inaugurated in Estonia in 2014 a form of virtual residency came into being which is supposed to be ‘an international “passport” to the virtual world’ While this passport essentially represents an entry ticket to the Estonian economy, e-citizens remain generally bound by their 'national identity', and as such tied to the corpus of a nation as well as to the body. 

Blockchain-based subjectivity, however, is conceived as purely virtual and code- or else data-based, and thus independently of any institutional pre-definition. No longer ‘dependent on a person's legal entitlement through citizenship or physical presence in a country’  


the transnational, digitized subject gains what is called ‘self-sovereign identity’: it is enabled to ‘manage [his/her] identity-related information  without the need to refer to any trusted authority or intermediary, by facilitating ‘trust and the secure sharing of information with multiple independent parties across broad networks’. 

With regard to its legal activities, the subject  therefore obtains the power to define, individually and on a case-by-case basis, the rules of its globally operative, automated and peer-to-peer legitimized existence. It is bound by—or binds itself to—the code alone, i.e. lex cryptographia, the foundation of which, as we have seen, is itself acephalous and fluid: individually negotiable, this law's terms and provisions depend on the respective transactional context or on the membership of the chosen ‘cloud community’. In that sense, the subject is conceived of as not only being detached from the heteronomous sovereignty of state and law—but eventually also from the heteronomy of its own body: this begins with the idea of ‘decentralized government services’ (‘just because you live in a particular geography should not restrict you to certain government services’ ) and ends with the plans for ‘personal thinking blockchains’, in the sense of ‘mindfiles’, i.e. ‘the recording of every “transaction” in the sense of capturing every thought and emotion of every entity, human and machine, encoding and archiving this activity into life-logging blockchains’. 



Why Do Blockchain Technology and Lex Cryptographia Matter?



Looking at the scenarios described above, the impacts of blockchain technology and its law seem, at first sight, to be limited to only a small number of legal contexts, and especially to the virtual realm. And as a matter of fact, the idea of a total emancipation of the body, of a complete disembodiment, the idea that blockchain would enable us to establish and administer social life in a completely virtual and body-less, text-less, and state-less manner, seems downright unrealistic and utopian (or rather dystopian). In a similar vein, authors such as Michèle Finck and others stress that the idea that blockchain technology could replace state and law is ‘misguided’, that the ‘success of blockchains is hence to no small degree contingent on recognition by the real world, and it simply cannot refuse to account for external legal requirements and systems’ (Finck 2018, p. 85); that ‘[c]ompliance with existing legal systems is required if blockchain and blockchain-based applications are to have a real-world impact’ (Finck 2018, p. 86). 

In political and legal contexts, we are currently observing a growing recognition of certain blockchain applications, especially those that pursue, in an increasingly sophisticated way, the emancipation of traditional ‘legal systems’. In the following, we shall therefore analyse why this new form of law has implications that go beyond its virtual and disembodied realm of applications and why it should be of concern to us all. Human life is necessarily bound to physical and bodily presence. And so it seems all the more appropriate to take a critical look at the imaginary and symbolic consequences that an expansion of the scope of application of these legal instruments, based on ideas of a virtual and disembodied existence, could entail; as well as to critically assess the claim that blockchain technology empowers the individual subject to be ‘self-sovereign’ by abolishing the heteronymic constraints of political and economic institutions. 

Lex Cryptographia’s Impact on the Traditional Social and Legal Imaginary


Firstly, we need to raise the question of what ideas of law, of legal values and ideals, initiated by this technology, might encroach on the traditional ‘collective imagination’. In this context, it seems appropriate to turn our focus to those blockchain applications that are currently enjoying increasing success, and that not only strive to establish decentralized and contractualist institutional structures, detached from national corpora and nomos, but which aim at establishing a new conception of justice: the platforms for ‘decentralized justice’ or ‘crowdsourced arbitration’.In line with the general effort of blockchain technology proponents, these applications promise to overcome the need to resort to national jurisdictions even in the event of legal disputes. This means that where—despite all efforts—the non-programmable nature of a human person, or a non-erasable ambivalence of contractual provisions requires legal interpretation or a posteriori dispute resolution, specific dispute resolution tools that operate transnationally and trans-jurisdictionally shall now take effect.



In order to give a brief overview of their functioning, we will take a look at the most developed, ambitious and successful project among those that exist so far: the application Kleros, which, by setting up ‘decentralized courts’, promises ‘fast, open and affordable justice for all’ . which is not only supposed to ‘mak[e] things faster and less expensive, but also to make the decisions better’.



 In accordance with the basic approach of blockchain technology, the referral to this decentralized jurisdiction occurs automatically, i.e. following the occurrence of certain conflicting circumstances in the context of an intelligent contract. It is therefore a procedure integrated into the contractual programming that does not cancel the automatic execution of the contract but suspends it until the conflict is resolved. 

The modus operandi of the so-called arbitration court is then based on a combination of crypto-economic principles and game theory. It departs from the assumption that people unknown to each other, who do not communicate and do not trust each other, can still reach a consensus by choosing certain ‘focal points’ (called Schelling points) that, so they assume, have characteristics that will lead others to choose them as well. In the case of the Kleros application, these focal points are ‘honesty and fairness’, i.e. the consensus to be determined is the just—or rather ‘true and fair’—judgment in a given dispute; the ‘people unknown to each other’ are jurors selected at random, according to a random number generator, on a case-by-case basis. Their function is to reach, independently of each other, a consensus of justice, which ultimately turns out to be a majority decision: the idea is ‘to vote what they think, other parties think, other parties think is honest and fair’ 


So far, ‘applications for Kleros include managing disputes over escrow accounts and insurance payments, and resolving claims of abuse on social networks’ .
